This readme file describes the content of the folder /Arabic/dela of the Unitex Arabic package. This folder contains electronic dictionaries of the Arabic; these lexicons comply with the LADL formalism. The files are in binary format (.bin and .inf), every lexicon of the list bellow is in .bin and .inf format.
To take adventage of these lexicons you have to lunch the external programs of the Unitex (Paumier, 2003) or the commands of its graphic interface. The user manuel of Unitex gives the details of all operation can be applied to the electronic dictionaries of Arabic package.
These resources are produced by application of the trancducers of the folder /Arabic/inflection on a list of lemmas. In Unitex graphic interface, under the command FSGraph-new we can manually create an inflection transducer. The time needed to create one transducer may be estimated to over two hours.
In our reaserch work we suggested a semi automatic method to creat the Arabic inflection transducers
